  First day of my class, though i was late i was lucky that the class wasn't started. We ,the teacher and us were introuced and learned how the course will move.
  Then we learned something about html(hyper text mark up language).Then the teacher gave us some task ani left us. After an hour our teacher came and checked our work wheater it was right or wrong.
