  First day of my class, though i was late i was lucky that the class wasn't started. We ,the teacher and us were introuced and learned how the course will move.
  Then we learned something about html(hyper text mark up language).Then the teacher gave us some task ani left us. After an hour our teacher came and checked our work wheater it was right or wrong.
</p>
<p>
  These are the things that we did in our first class. It was qiute fun and hope ti will be fun in the comming days
